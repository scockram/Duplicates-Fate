Overview
========

Simulation is done in a number of stages:

  * Network generation
  * Duplication analysis
  * Results condensation
  * Results analysis

Distributed computing speeds the first 2 stages dramatically, SGE (Sun Grid Engine) can
be used in conjuction with the script "tests.sh" to accomplish this. Once the results have
been condensed analysis can be done with whatever tool is preferred.

A number of auxillary ruby scripts are provided that provide some simple file manipulation,
this is a lot easier than working with files in matlab.

Compatible with at least the following versions of matlab:

  * 7.11.0.584 (R2010b) 
  * 7.8.0.347 (R2009a)


Network Generation
==================

Using generate_networks.m, requirements for the network are specified in this file. Creates
files Data/Networks/*/<HASH>.mat and records a list of networks in Data/Networks/*/valids.txt.


Duplication Analysis
====================

Using processnetworks.m, settings for the mutations are given in this file. Creates files
Data/Dynamics/*/<HASH>.mat for each network.


Results Condensation
====================

With condenseresults.m, outputs Data/Dynamics/*/data.mat that contains equal length vectors
for all relevant variables.

Note: Doesn't require parallelising -- reasonably fast.


Results Analysis
